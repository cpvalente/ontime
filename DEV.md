# GETTING STARTED

Ontime consists of 3 distinct parts
- __client__: A React app for Ontime's interface and web clients 
- __electron__: An electron app which facilitates cross-platform distribution of ontime
- __server__: A nodejs application which handles the domains services and integrations


## LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
The server is only necessary to distribute an installable version of the app, and it is not necessary for local development.
Locally, we would need to run both the React client and the node.js server in dev mode

- __Install the project dependencies__ by running `pnpm i` in the project root
- __Run dev mode__ by running `turbo dev` in the project root

## CREATE AN INSTALLABLE FILE (Win + MacOS + Linux)
