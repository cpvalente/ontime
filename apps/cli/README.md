Congratulations! You got this far into Ontime's rabbit hole and want to manage your installation.

The CLI tool is a fast and lightweight way of installing Ontime and is perfect for self-hosting and headless installs.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
You will need to have installed the correct version of node.js
Please check [the app engines declaration](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/blob/master/package.json) for the correct version.

### Running Ontime
To get Ontime running, all you need to do is install it in your system using your package manager of choice:

Install globally in your system
