# Ontime
Ontime is an application for managing event rundowns and running stage timers.

It allows a center application to be able to distribute event information in the local network. This minimises needs for using Media Server outputs or expensive video distribution while allowing easy integration in workflows including OBS and d3.

## Using Ontime
Once installed and running, ontime starts a background server that is the heart of all processes.
The app, is used to add / edit your running order in the event list, and running the timers using the Playback Control function.

From here, any device in the same network with a browser is able to render the views as described. This is done by reaching the ontime server at the _default port 4001_ eg: `localhost:4001` or `192.168.1.3:4001`
You can then use the the ontime logo on the top right corner to select the desired view.

In case of unnatended machines or automations, it is possible to use different URL to recall individual views

```
IP.ADDRESS:4001           > Web server default to stage timer view
IP.ADDRESS:4001/speaker   > Speaker / Stage timer view
IP.ADDRESS:4001/sm        > Stage Manager / Backstage view
IP.ADDRESS:4001/public    > Public / Foyer view
IP.ADDRESS:4001/pip       > Picture in Picture view
IP.ADDRESS:4001/lower     > Lower Thirds
```

## Feature List (in no specific order)
- [x] Distribute Data over network and render in the browser
- [x] Different screen types
  - Stage Timer
  - Backstage Info
  - Public Info
  - Picture in Picture
- [x] Configurable realtime Lower Thirds
- [x] Send live messages to different screen types
- [x] Ability to differentiate between backstage and public data
- [x] Manage delays workflow
- [x] OSC Control and Feedback
- [x] Roll mode: run independently using the system clock

## Unopinionated
We are not interested in forcing workflows and have made ontime so it is flexible to whichever way you would like to work.


- [x] You do not need an order list to use the timer. Create an empty event and the OSC API works just the same
- [x] If you want just the info screens, no need to use the timer!
- [x] Dont have or care for a schedule?
  - [x] a single event with no data is enough to use the OSC API and get going
  - [x] use the order list to create a set of quick timers by setting the beggining and start times to 00:00 and 00:10 (**BAM**! 10 minute timer). You can quick recall this with OSC as always

## Roadmap
### For version 1
Almost reaching a feature set that we can call v1. Before that:
- [ ] Mac OS version
- [ ] Finish Documentation
### Continuing
- [ ] Linux version
- [ ] Headless version (run server only anywhere, configure from a browser locally)
- [ ] Companion integration
- [ ] Lower Third Manager
- [ ] Note only event
- [ ] URL Aliases (define configurable aliases to ease onsite setup)
- [ ] Logging view
- [ ] Reach Schedule: way to speedup timer to meet a deadline

### Issues
The app is still in pre-release and there are a few issues, mainly concerning style.
This will be receiving attention as we near v1 release

### iOS
- [ ] Views do not render in iOS devices. this is being prioritized and will be fixed soon
#### Style
- [ ] App appears visually broken: Please ensure that windows settings have no display zoom (it is 125% by default)
- [ ] app needs improvement on handling zoomed interfaces
- [ ] Very long titles might cause interface to shift
