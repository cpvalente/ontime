## Using Ontime?

# Ontime

Ontime is a browser-based application that manages event rundowns, scheduling, and cueing.

With Ontime, you can plan, track your schedule, manage automation and cross-department show information all in one place.

Ontime is made by entertainment and broadcast engineers and used by

- Conference organisers
- Touring shows and receiving venues
- Broadcasters and streamers
- Theatres and opera houses
- Houses of worship

## Main features
- **Multiplatform**: Available as a Cloud service and for Windows, macOS, Linux, or self-hosted via Docker.
- **In any device**: Ontime is available to any device with a browser, eg: tablets, mobile phones, laptops, signage, media servers...
- **Team Collaboration**: Dedicated views for directors, operators, backstage, and signage.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Manage and communicate runtime delays effortlessly.
- **Automatable**: Ontime can be fully or partially controlled by an operator, or run standalone with the system clock
- **Flexible Integrations**: Use one of the APIs provided (OSC, HTTP, Websocket) or the available [Companion module](https://bitfocus.io/connections/getontime-ontime) to integrate into your workflow (vMix, disguise, Qlab, OBS)

... and a lot more ...

### For live environments

Ontime is designed for use in live environments. \
This guides the application into being flexible and efficiently integrating into different workflows.

### For teams

All information added in Ontime is shared with the production team and other software / hardware in your workflow. \
Ontime also improves team collaboration with dedicated views for cuesheets and operators, and for public and production
signage.

### Simple infrastructure

All the data is distributed over the network, making its distribution and infrastructure flexible and cheap. \
With the availability of the docker image, you can also leverage IT infrastructure to make Ontime available online for
your team and clients.

Ontime is made by video engineers and entertainment technicians.

## Using Ontime

### Getting started

The easiest way to start with Ontime is by leveraging our [Cloud service](https://getontime.no). \
This will give you immediate access to running instances of Ontime which are available to share with anyone with an internet connection.

Alternatively, you can run Ontime locally for free by downloading the latest release for your platform or using the docker image, available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/getontime/ontime)

Once installed and running, any device that shares the same network as Ontime will have access to Ontime.

More information is available [in our docs](https://docs.getontime.no)

Ontime is under active development. We continue adding and improving features in collaboration with users.
