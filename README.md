## Using Ontime?
Let us know!
Ontime improves from the collaboration with its users. We would like to understand how you use Ontime and appreciate your feedback.

We would also like to include a testimonials section in our ✨new website✨. It would be great to showcase the diversity of users running Ontime.

# Ontime

Ontime is a browser-based application that manages event rundowns, scheduling, and cueing.

With Ontime, you can plan, track your schedule, manage automation and cross-department show information all in one place.

Ontime is made by entertainment and broadcast engineers and used by

- Conference organisers
- Touring shows and receiving venues
- Broadcasters and streamers
- Theatres and opera houses
- Houses of worship

## Main features
- [x] **Multiplatform**: Available for Windows / MacOS, Linux. You can also self host with the docker image
- [x] **In any device**: Ontime is available in the local network to any device with a browser, eg: tablets, mobile phones, laptops, signage, media servers...
- [x] **Made for teams**: Ontime caters to different roles in your production team: directors, operators, backstage and front of house signage...
- [x] **Delay workflows**: Manage and communicate runtime delays in real-time to your team
- [x] **Automatable**: Ontime can be fully or partially controlled by an operator, or run standalone with the system clock
- [x] **Focus on integrations**: Use one of the APIs provided (OSC, HTTP, Websocket) or the available [Companion module](https://bitfocus.io/connections/getontime-ontime) to integrate into your workflow (vMix, disguise, Qlab, OBS)

... and a lot more ...

### For live environments

Ontime is designed for use in live environments. \
This guides the application into being flexible and efficiently integrating into different workflows.

### For teams

All information added in Ontime is shared with the production team and other software / hardware in your workflow. \
Ontime also improves team collaboration with dedicated views for cuesheets and operators, and for public and production
signage.

### Simple infrastructure

All the data is distributed over the network, making its distribution and infrastructure flexible and cheap. \
With the availability of the docker image, you can also leverage IT infrastructure to make Ontime available online for
your team and clients.

Ontime is made by video engineers and entertainment technicians.

## Using Ontime

Ontime can be started by downloading the latest release for your platform. \
Alternatively you can also use the docker image, available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/getontime/ontime)

Once installed and running, any device in the network has access to Ontime.

Ontime provides different screens which allow for different types of interactions with the data. These are called
views. \
Each view in Ontime focuses on empowering a specific role or achieving a particular task.

You can access the different views by reaching the ontime server, in your browser, at (_default port
4001_) `http://localhost:4001` or `http://192.168.1.3:4001`

```
For the backstage views
-------------------------------------------------------------
IP.ADDRESS:4001/timer      > Presenter / Stage timer view
IP.ADDRESS:4001/minimal    > Simple timer view
IP.ADDRESS:4001/clock      > Simple clock view
IP.ADDRESS:4001/backstage  > Stage Manager / Backstage view
IP.ADDRESS:4001/countdown  > Countdown to anything
IP.ADDRESS:4001/studio     > Studio Clock
IP.ADDRESS:4001/timeline   > Timeline
```

```
For the public views
-------------------------------------------------------------
IP.ADDRESS:4001/public     > Public / Foyer view
IP.ADDRESS:4001/lower      > Lower Thirds
```

```
For production views
-------------------------------------------------------------
IP.ADDRESS:4001/editor    > the control interface, same as the app
IP.ADDRESS:4001/cuesheet  > realtime cuesheets for collaboration
IP.ADDRESS:4001/operator  > automated views for operators
```

## Roadmap

### Continued development

Ontime is under active development. We continue adding and improving features in collaboration with users.

Have an idea? Reach out via [email](mail@getontime.no)
or [open an issue](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/issues/new)

### Issues

We use Github's issue tracking for bug reporting and feature requests. \
Found a bug? [Open an issue](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/issues/new).

#### Unsigned App

When installing the app you would see warning screens from the Operating System like:

in Windows

`Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognised app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk.`

or in Linux

`Could Not Display "ontime-linux.AppImage`

We currently only sign MacOS releases. \
Purchasing the certificates for both Mac and Windows would mean a recurrent expense which we are not able to cover.

You can circumvent this by allowing the execution of the app manually.

- In Windows: click `more` -> `Run Anyway`
- In Linux: right-click the AppImage file: `Properties` -> `Permissions` -> `Allow Executing File as a Program`

If you have tips on how to improve this or would like to sponsor the code signing,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/issues/new)
