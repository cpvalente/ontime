# Terms of sponsorship
Ontime does not exist as a fiscal entity. The sponsorship recipient is the project owner. In this light, contributors are funding the project owner's capacity to work on the project, not the project itself. As a contribution recipient, the code owner reserves the right to redistribute.

## Why sponsor
Ontime is and will remain free, regardless of your decision to contribute.
Regardless, you may choose to provide a monetary contribution:

### Improve user experience
Certain parts of the application user experience are tied to our capacity to pay for services. App signing and Google Sheets integration are good examples of this.

### Cool stuff
We may choose not to implement some features. This could be related to the complexity required, to the skill set, or to the fact that we just feel it doesn't improve the app for a significant percentage of users. In those cases, a feature may be considered "not worth it," regardless of its pertinence.

As a user, you can choose to sponsor a particular feature or donate to the app so that we can create bounties for features.

### Priorities
Monetary contributions are most immediately needed to offset the costs of presenting and distributing Ontime, i.e., hosting, domains, and certificates.

Additional funding will be considered according to the needs at the time.
